# PLY-Calculator---COS-280
This is a basic calculator implementation using PLY. Currently the calculator supports parenthetical operations, trigonometric operations, and includes reserved terms for numbers pi and e. Future improvements include logarithmic operations and matrix operations. The end goal is to implement a scientific calculator, excluding graphing capability.
